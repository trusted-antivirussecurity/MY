<p>These days our computers and smart devices run a wide range of applications. We&rsquo;re racing ahead into the future and want to make our day to day lives simpler, faster and more convenient. So how does a PC Cleaner come into play? What does it do? And, most importantly, do you need one?</p>

<p>First off, can you remember how efficient and speedy your out-of-the-box computer felt? It was incredible, right? Fast-forward not so long into the future, however, and you&rsquo;ve likely noticed a significant decline. You&rsquo;re not really sure why or how it happened, yet you choose to put up with it anyway, trudging through slower loading times, increased errors and general frustration. You&rsquo;ve got a problem, and yelling at the screen doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working.</p>

<p>Naturally, with this issue firmly on the computer user radar, a market door swung open for the PC Cleaner, a piece of software developed to optimize device performance. In other words, enhancing speed and functionality, restoring a device back to the &lsquo;honeymoon period&rsquo; days. Some PC Cleaner brands also offer more than just performance optimization, such as increased privacy protection and security tools.</p>

<p>OK, but what does a PC Cleaner actually do to make life sweeter? Well, over the years your computer has collected a mountain of various cached data &ndash; many unused &ndash; such as registry settings, cookies and browser history files. This means you&rsquo;re left with a cluttered, overcrowded hard drive, resulting in slower operating times and more colourful language.</p>

<p>Simply put, a PC Cleaner will endeavour to clean up all this dead wood or &lsquo;junk files&rsquo;, leading to a faster computer, less errors/crashes, a quicker startup, and even safer internet browsing.</p>
