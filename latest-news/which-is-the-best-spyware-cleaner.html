  <div class="grid-container main-content"><div class="grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y"><div class="cell medium-12 large-9"><h1>Which Is The Best Spyware Cleaner?</h1><p>&#39;Spyware&#39; is an extremely dangerous variation&nbsp;of malware&nbsp;(the general term for a computer program created solely out of malice: with intent to cause harm to someone&#39;s computer or steal sensitive information/files). The consequences of contracting spyware and not removing it instantly can be catastrophic. In most&nbsp;cases, it leads to theft of some sort; your identity and&nbsp;money are the most common targets for the creators of this particular malware strain. &#39;Spyware&#39; is an umbrella term for a multitude of illegal programs, for example, keyloggers and trojans, which you may have heard mentioned in the news. In general, they are awfully bad news, but that&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t a way to prevent being spied on in the first place...</p>

<p>If you look online, you&#39;ll be able to find hundreds of companies offering antivirus software, but not all of them are up to scratch. There are plenty of factors you need to take into account when choosing the best security suite for your needs, there are price and feature sets just to start! But we aren&#39;t looking for an anti-virus, we are looking for a piece of software which can reliably remove and protect our computer from spyware. For this, we highly recommend Scanguard.â€‹</p>

<p>Compared to other spyware removal choices, Scanguard is a baby.&nbsp;Their software has only been on the market for 6 months at the time of writing this article, but don&#39;t let that take away from the program&#39;s astounding ability to pinpoint existing computer safety threats. Not only will Scanguard find and remove all threatening malware from your PC (or Mac), but it also&nbsp;protects your machine from attacks in real-time and can even&nbsp;provide performance&nbsp;optimizations, which is worthy of the small monthly fee all by itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spyware is designed to lay low and undetected, meaning those with this type of malware on their computer are, more often than not, completely unaware. To quote&nbsp;the age old adage &quot;better safe than sorry&quot;, here at TheTop10Antivirus.com we wholly recommend running a free Scanguard scan to see if you are affected, even if you are 100% sure your computer is secure.</p>
</div><div class="cell show-for-large large-3"><div class="sidebar-tile"><div class="content-box"><p>We believe malware detection scores from <a href="independant-antivirus-testing-and-certification-by-labs.html" target="_blank">independent test institutes</a> such as; av-test, virus bulletin, and av-comparatives are important when selecting your virus protection. We have collated some scores for you, however we don&#39;t display by test scores alone, many factors are used.</p>
