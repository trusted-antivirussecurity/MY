Internet banking bought about the introduction of online bank fraud, for example. E-mail and telephone hacking have been some of the biggest scandals in recent years. Before any of this, was the computer virus - blighting generations of computer users to varying degrees.</p>

<p>Virus protection is a vital weapon in any computer user&#39;s arsenal, protecting and shielding the user from malicious entites online - saving the user thousands of dollars in some cases. Computer viruses exist in many different forms - some intended to annoy computer users (like pre-historic trolling, if you will) and others build to cause maximum harm. Without protection, these viruses can infect your computer without realizing, and it can be too late before you know it.</p>

<p>&#39;I&#39;m not stupid enough to contract a computer virus&#39; you may be thinking to yourself - chances are you could be right, but is it even worth the risk these days? Computer viruses are no longer only a problem for chat-room habitants or mass-downloaders - downloading the wrong piece of software, clicking the wrong link, or even opening the wrong email can lead to a virus installing itself on your machine, and making it very difficult for you to remove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Virus protection comes in many different forms - you may have heard of the terms &#39;firewall&#39; and &#39;anti-virus&#39; before, both methods of protecting yourself from harmful programs. Although these services do different jobs, the main aim is the same - virus protection. By making it more difficult for malicious programs to install themselves on your machine, virus protection services are your first line of defense against evil online entities.&nbsp;</p>
